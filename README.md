# Project objectives

In this project, based on the file "Databreaches650" provided, our group would like to work on the data, apply some appropriate models, techiniques to conduct some analysis and prediction.

- Exploration and identification of important trends of past data breaches: In this group work, we will create a machine learning model (Linear regression model) to analysis most impactful independent variables/factors. 

- Predict various aspects of future data breaches: we will create a machine learning model based on the given data to identify which factors/ independent variables will impact more in the future data breaches.

# Analysis 
All analysis files can be found in the 'analysis' folder and should all be capable of running independently. The general structure of the files as follows: 
- Data mining
- Data transformation
- Linear Regression
- 
- Output
- Note: running the analysis files will generate files in the 'results' and 'charts' folders as part of their operation.

# Folder Structure

- Analysis

- Datasets: folder contains the datasets provided, additional dataset

- Notes: general notes taken and observed for each task during the analysis.

- Minutes: notes taken during our meetings

- Other: folder for extra files, such as the custom font used in the graphs
